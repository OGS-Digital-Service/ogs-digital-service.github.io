This is a link to [something else](https://ogs.ny.gov). And an enire paragraph of something. 


The particulars of your body copy will be determined by the topic of your page. Regardless of topic, it’s a good practice to follow the inverted pyramid structure when writing copy: Begin with the information that’s most important to your users and then present information of less importance.


Keep each section and subsection focused — a good approach is to include one theme (topic) per section.

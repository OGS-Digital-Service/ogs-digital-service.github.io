OGS Digital Service Accessibility Reporting Environment


# Hello!
This is an accessibility lab sandbox type environment for the NYS Digital Service. It allows us to rapidly iterate and test new features, design components, test workflows and real world scenarios, proof of concept things, and try out integrating new technologies without breaking everything. It's open source, MIT license. As of right now I hope no one uses anything here because it's really rough. If you do, please let us know at Digital@ogs.ny.gov
